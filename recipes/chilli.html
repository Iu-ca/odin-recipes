    <h3 class="headings">Description</h3>
      <p class="con">This famous chilli recipe is the Texas-style chilli con carne, which is known for its bold and robust flavor. This recipe typically includes cubed beef chuck, onions, garlic, chilli powder, cumin, beef broth, tomatoes, and sometimes even chocolate or coffee if <em>you're insane</em>.</p>

      <p class="con">The chilli is simmered for hours until the meat is tender and the flavors have <em>melded</em> together. It is often served with toppings such as shredded cheese, sour cream, and green onions. Texas-style chilli is a classic comfort food and has become a staple in many households and restaurants across the United States.</p>
