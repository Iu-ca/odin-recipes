  <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Pierogi are a traditional Polish dumpling that are typically boiled or fried and filled with a variety of savory or sweet ingredients. The dough is made with flour, water, and sometimes eggs, and is rolled out and cut into circles. The filling can be made with mashed potatoes and cheese, sauerkraut and mushrooms, ground meat, or fruit. Once the filling is placed inside the dough, the edges are crimped together to seal it shut.</p> 
    
    <p>Pierogi are a beloved dish in Polish cuisine and can be found in many other Eastern European countries as well. They can be served as a main course or as a snack, and are often topped with butter, sour cream, or fried onions.</p>
